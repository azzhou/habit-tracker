# Habit Tracker
Track daily habits and routines with this web application. Users can add habits that they want to strengthen (or break), and a daily checklist is provided to keep them accountable. Charts and stats are generated to visually represent progress. E.g. longest streaks of habit completion, Github-style activity grid, graph of rolling average completion rate. Please see the [homepage](https://habit-tracker-az.herokuapp.com/home/) for more information and screenshots.
